Not implemented as of 07/07/17

We realized that if we wanted to have a nice layout for the tennis
console we couldn't do like we did with other sports, too many buttons.

We figured the best way was to add some coding behind it so that the user only
has two buttons per player ( + and -) and that a method in the TennisModel
would then calculate the score based on previous player score and return it to the view.

Should not be that difficult be we just lacked time to implement this.
